When tags only have one article associated with it, this plugin will redirect links to the associated article instead of the tag page.

== Description ==

When tags only have one article associated with it, this plugin will redirect links to the associated article instead of the tag page. This can improve SEO as users are directly brought to your article instead of the snippet.

Tag-links on your page will be changed to article-links as long as the tag has only one article. If a tag page with a single article is requested, e.g. through search-engine caching, this plugin will redirect the request to the article.

Can be combined with the [No Single Article Tags in Tag Cloud](https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-single-article-tags-in-tag-cloud/) plugin.
